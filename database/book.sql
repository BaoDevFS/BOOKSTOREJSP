This CD is accompanied by sumptuous illustrations from Jackie Morris, new spells by Robert Macfarlane, enlightening thoughts by Robert, Jackie and Spell Singer Karine Polwart as well as stunning photography by Elly Lucas. In 2018 Folk by the Oak Festival commissioned Spell Songs because of their love of The Lost Words. \n<br> \n<br> Spell Songs comprises eight remarkable musicians whose music engages deeply with landscape and nature; musicians who are perfectly placed to respond to the creatures, art and language of The Lost Words. They spent a week in Herefordshire bringing this music together in the company of Jackie Morris. Art inspired music and music inspired art. Jackie Morris immersed herself in the musical residency where she generously created new iconesque artwork of each musician and their instruments portrayed in an unexpected and enchanting way. These stunning new artworks accompany the CD.\n<br> \n<br> Spell Songs allowed these acclaimed and diverse musicians to weave together elements of British folk music, Senegalese folk traditions, and experimental and classical music to create an inspiring new body of work. \n<br> \n<br> Here are 14 songs which capture the essence of The Lost Words book. Spoken voice, whispers, accents, dialects, native languages, proverbs, sayings, birdsong, river chatter and insect hum all increase the intimacy of the musical world conjured by the songs. Inspired by the words, art and ethos of The Lost Words book, each musician brings new imaginings, embellishments and diversions which are rooted in personal experience, a deep respect for the natural world, protest at the loss of nature and its language and an appreciation for wildness and beauty. \n<br> \n<br> In February 2019 Spell Songs enjoyed standing ovations at sell-out performances in major venues across the UK culminating at The Queen Elizabeth Hall at the Southbank Centre, London. Spell Songs was a highlight of The Hay International Literary Festival 2019 and in August 2019 they were invited to perform at the BBCs Lost Words Prom in the Royal Albert Hall. They will continue to tour each year.\n<br> There are songs here that would live with me for the rest of my years, even if Id had no part in their making., Robert Macfarlane\n<br> \n<a class=read-more>show more</a>', 0, 27.03, NULL, 10, 2019, 1, NULL, '2019-11-21 21:47:30', '2019-11-21 21:47:30', 1, 'Robert Macfarlane');

Some 1,500 illustrations portray the staggering, spectacular legacy that Leonardo left behind on paper and canvas. Through Bambachs comprehensive research, Leonardo emerges as a figure who both embodies his era and completely transcends it, enduring as one of historys greatest artists, scientists, and inventors.\n<br> \n<a class=read-more>show more</a>', 0, 591.81, NULL, 10, 2019, 1, NULL, '2019-11-21 21:47:30', '2019-11-21 21:47:30', 1, 'Carmen C.

He shows how, influenced by such different teachers as David Bomberg and William Coldstream, and aware of the work of contemporaries such as Jackson Pollock as well as the traditions of Western art from Piero della Francesca to Picasso and Matisse, the postwar painters were allied in their confidence that this ancient medium, in opposition to photography and other media, could do fresh and marvellous things.

Five agonising days went by before she was found in a nearby village. The child remembered nothing of these events and nobody ever spoke of them at home.

Born in obscurity in Putney, he became a fixer for Cardinal Wolsey in the 1520s. After Wolseys fall, Henry VIII promoted him to a series of ever greater offices, and by the end of the 1530s he was effectively running the country for the King. That decade was one of the most momentous in English history: it saw a religious break with the Pope, unprecedented use of parliament, the dissolution of all monasteries. Cromwell was central to all this, but establishing his role with precision, at a distance of nearly five centuries and after the destruction of many of his papers at his own fall, has been notoriously difficult.\n<br> \n<br> Diarmaid MacCullochs biography is much the most complete and persuasive life ever written of this elusive figure, a masterclass in historical detective work, making connections not previously seen. It overturns many received interpretations, for example that Cromwell was a cynical, secular politician without deep-felt religious commitment, or that he and Anne Boleyn were allies because of their common religious sympathies - in fact he destroyed her. It introduces the many different personalities of these foundational years, all conscious of the terrifyingly unpredictable Henry VIII. MacCulloch allows readers to feel that they are immersed in all this, that it is going on around them.\n<br> \n<br> For a time, the self-made ruffian (as he described himself) - ruthless, adept in the exercise of power, quietly determined in religious revolution - was master of events.

Between two world wars, he became the laureate of cricket by doing the same with words.\n<br> \n<br> In The Great Romantic, award-winning author Duncan Hamilton demonstrates how Cardus changed sports journalism for ever. While popularising cricket - while appealing, in Cardus words to people who didnt know a leg-break from the pavilion cat at Lords- he became a star in his own right with exquisite phrase-making, disdain for statistics and a penchant for literary and musical allusions. \n<br> \n<br> Among those who venerated Cardus were PG Wodehouse, John Arlott, Harold Pinter, JB Priestley and Don Bradman. However, behind the rhapsody in blue skies, green grass and colourful characters, this richly evocative biography finds that Cardus mother was a prostitute, he never knew his father and he received negligible education. Infatuations with younger women ran parallel to a decidedly unromantic marriage. And, astonishingly, the supreme stylists aversion to factual accuracy led to his reporting on matches he never attended. \n<br> \n<br> Yet Cardus also belied his impoverished origins to prosper in a second class-conscious profession, becoming a music critic of international renown.

The Times\n<br> \n<br> The World in Thirty-Eight Chapters or Dr Johnsons Guide to Life is a source of profound good sense about what it means to teach, read, write and travel. More than that, though, Henry Hitchings continually translates Samuel Johnsons experience of poverty, scorn, pain and madness into a rich understanding of how to be.\n<br> \n<br> Samuel Johnson was a critic, an essayist, a poet and a biographer. He was also, famously, the compiler of the first good English dictionary, published in 1755. A polymath and a great conversationalist, his intellectual and social curiosity were boundless.

In his own life, both public and private, he sought to choose a virtuous and prudent path, negotiating everyday hazards and temptations. His writings and aphorisms illuminate what it means to lead a life of integrity, and his experience, abundantly documented by him and by others (such as James Boswell and Hester Thrale), is a lesson in the art of regulating the mind and the body.\n<br> \n<br> Johnsons story touches on many themes that have enduring significance.

In February 1944, as Japanese military advances threatened to engulf Australasia, a tiny, four-pound Yorkshire terrier was discovered hiding in a Japanese shell scrape amidst the thick jungles of Papua New Guinea. The GIs who discovered her presumed she had been some kind of Japanese army mascot, but it soon turned out that she understood neither commands rendered in Japanese nor English. A mystery, she was adopted by Corporal William Bill Wynne, an air-crewman with the US 5th Air Forces 26th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron.\n<br> \n<br> Living in Bill Wynnes tent, sleeping on a piece of green felt salvaged from a card table,and sharing his rations, Smoky became the de facto mascot of the regiment. She went on to fly numerous photo-recce and air-sea rescue missions, cocooned in a soldiers pack hanging next to the machine-guns used to repel marauding Japanese fighters. She was awarded eight battle stars, surviving dozens of Japanese combat raids on Papua New Guinea, and braving a typhoon that ravaged Okinawa. After saving Wynnes life by warning of a falling shell, as their landing craft approached an enemy-held beach - a shell that killed the eight men that Wynne was standing beside - he nicknamed her the angel from a foxhole. In one of her most famous exploits Smoky parachuted using a special rig designed to fit one of the worlds smallest but toughest dogs.\n<br> \n<br> In perhaps her most heroic exploit of all, Smoky ran a cable through a seventy-foot pipe no wider in places than four inches, to enable telephone lines to be run across the recently occupied airbase of Luzon. Her efforts saved hundreds of ground-crew from being exposed to enemy bombing, preventing injury and loss of life.

His task to turn back the Allied assault already seems hopeless.\n<br> \n<br> Alongside Rommel are a set of elite commanders, each driven by their own ambitions, ideas and armies. At the frontline sits Erich Marcks, the wounded General tasked with the mighty burden of building up the coastal defences, all with inadequate supplies and a shortage of men. He is flanked by Hans von Salmuth, a relative novice but a favourite of the Fuhrer, who has been assigned the lofty duty of defending Calais; the place Command believes will be the focal point of the Allied Invasion. At the rear, General Major Bayerlien is preparing the elite panzer divisions for what may lie ahead, while General Major Pemsel is struggling to coordinate efforts to prepare the Seventh Army, believing that should an invasion come, he will be the hub of the German response.\n<br> \n<br> All of these local commanders are subject to the whims of Hitler, hundreds of miles away but continually issuing orders increasingly divorced from the reality of the war.

In such circumstances good leadership can be the defining factor in victory or defeat. This book is about the extraordinary leadership of seven men who led American soldiers on D-Day and the days that followed. Some of them, like Eisenhower, Theodore Roosevelt Jr, and Lieutenant Dick Winters, are well known while others are barely a footnote in the history books. \n<br> \n<br> All of them made a dramatic difference during Operation Overlord. All understood that they had a mission to accomplish and that if they failed to lead that mission would fail and more men would die.

Leadership was the only ingredient that would get them through the storm of death surrounding them and their men.\n<br> \n<br> This book is not a full history of D-Day, nor does it cover the heroic leadership shown by men in the armies of the Allies or members of the French Resistance who also participated in the Normandy assault and battles for the lodgment areas.

In Bocage and Breakout, Leo Marriott and Simon Forty take the story forward as the success of the invasion continued into the Cotentin, with Cherbourg falling on 29 June, before it bogged down in face of determined German defense and the bocage countryside-innumerable small fields surrounded by hedgerows, each one hiding anti-tank weapons, mortars and machine guns. As US First Army fought its way south, on the eastern edges of the bridgehead, British and Canadian forces were fighting a war of attrition around Caen facing the bulk of the German armor as division after division was fed into Normandy. Like a pressure cooker, the fighting intensified until, seven weeks after D-Day, Operation Cobra broke the German line. Quickly Pattons Third Army, operational from 1 August, flooded through the gap exploiting the German confusion, encircling what was left of the German armies in the Falaise Pocket and advancing quickly through into Brittany. Three weeks later, the Battle of Normandy was over, the routed German Army-without most of its heavy weapons left in the Falaise Pocket or on the banks of the Seine-was retreating helter skelter back towards Germany and the Low Countries pursued by the Allies in a reverse of the 1940 Blitzkrieg campaign.\n<br> \n<br> The three months of war in June-July 1944 were brutal, with losses of front-line troops as heavy as in World War I. The German defense was tenacious, particularly in face of Allied air supremacy. The Allies struggled to get into a position to allow their more mobile forces room for maneuver and and the fighting was ferocious. \n<br> \n<br> When victory came, it came at a cost: 209,672 casualties among the ground forces, including 36,976 killed and 19,221 missing. The Allied air forces lost 16,714 airmen. The corresponding German losses were even more significant: some 450,000 men, of whom 240,000 were killed or wounded. More important to the Germans were the losses of heavy equipment-tanks, assault guns, artillery, personnel carriers. As an example, 12th SS Panzer Division had lost 94% of its armor, nearly all of its artillery and 70% of its vehicles.

Rich with color images, famous photographs and original 3-D maps, the 9 x 12 volume also presents the timeline of events, places and personalities, giving a complete picture of the campaign across France. The volume won a Silver Medal in the 2012 Independent Publisher Book Awards (IPPY) in the World History category and Best Book 2012 in the History: Military/Political category from USA Book News.\n<br> \n<a class=read-more>show more</a>', 0, 73.65, NULL, 10, 2014, 1, NULL, '2019-11-21 21:47:30', '2019-11-21 21:47:30', 7, 'Jay Wertz');

Spread over five beaches assigned to the US and to British/Canadian Forces, the need for detailed planning was paramount. There were obviously troops to assemble and the armada of ships, boats and tugs to transport the men and equipment to their destinations, but these preparations were made only in the very final stages of planning. The real blueprints for D-Day had been laid years earlier: for example, the Duplex Drive tanks used from D-Day onwards were the subject of a US patent which was filed on 13 March 1942. \n<br> \n<br> Additionally, the Beach Groups, a combined British Force comprising all three services, assembled in Scotland in the summer/autumn of 1943, and spent many months on manoeuvres. Operation PLUTO (PipeLine Under The Ocean) started on 14 August 1942, involving engineers, scientists and members of the armed forces working together to design and develop a pipeline capable of being deployed from the Isle of Wight to the Normandy Beaches, pumping fuel to Normandy.\n<br> \n<br> Work on the Mulberry Harbour, the floating temporary harbour erected on two sites supplying British/Canadian soldiers from one beach and the American troops from another, commenced in 1941 at Garlieston, Scotland. Fabrication of the Phoenix caissons took place along the English South Coast. Some of the Phoenix caissons were abandoned where they were made and are still visible today.\n<br> \n<br> Further activities were planned to support the French and create an infrastructure. In one case the Royal Engineers landed a train in case the retreating Germans either destroyed the railway network or immobilised the trains. Additionally an organisation, known as Civil Affairs, moved in behind the tanks to set up civil administration. This unit moved slowly through France to Holland.\n<br> \n<br> The author provides rich and fascinating detail on these and other aspects of the thorough and surprisingly early preparations in the UK for D-Day and the battle for Normandy.\n<br> \n<a class=read-more>show more</a>', 45, 44.30, NULL, 10, 2014, 1, NULL, '2019-11-21 21:47:30', '2019-11-21 21:47:30', 7, 'Dr David Rogers');

Even today the vestiges of Hitlers Atlantic Wall speak of the huge undertaking necessary for the Allies to gain a foothold in Normandy. In this beautiful new full-color book, the reader goes on-site to the sacred battleground from its scarred medieval villages to the remains of modern means of destruction. \n<br> \n<br> The huge armada that attacked from Britain left behind many signs of their passage: from the huge caissons of the mulberry harbor around Arromanches, the gun emplacements at Longues and Merville, to the multitude of hardware used as memorials-tanks, artillery, pillboxes-and the many graves and cemeteries that honor those who died on both sides. It is in memory of the dead that much of what can be seen on the ground survives, but as the last few survivors reach their 90s, a new audience requires information about the events of the past that can only come from seeing the ground where the battle was fought. Today, the beaches are a fascinating mixture of the new and the old, including the new visitors center at Colleville and the renovation and expansion of the Utah Beach museum-even as further new memorials jostle with the older sites that have changed little in 70 years.\n<br> \n<br> The Normandy Battlefields details what can be seen on the ground today using a mixture of media to provide a complete overview of the campaign. Maps old and new highlight what has survived and what hasnt; then-and-now photography allows fascinating comparisons with the images taken at the time-particularly the aerial views-and computer artwork provides graphic details of things that cant be seen today.\n<br> \n<br> The book describes the area from Cherbourg to Le Havre by way of the key D-Day locations, providing a handbook for the visitor and an overview for the armchair traveller. It covers, wherever possible, the forces from both sides and the memorials to those young men who fought so many years ago.\n<br> \n<a class=read-more>show more</a>', 0, 33.72, NULL, 10, 2014, 1, NULL, '2019-11-21 21:47:30', '2019-11-21 21:47:30', 7, 'Leo Marriott');

In Bocage and Breakout, Leo Marriott and Simon Forty take the story forward as the success of the invasion continued into the Cotentin, with Cherbourg falling on 29 June, before it bogged down in face of determined German defense and the bocage countryside-innumerable small fields surrounded by hedgerows, each one hiding anti-tank weapons, mortars and machine guns. As US First Army fought its way south, on the eastern edges of the bridgehead, British and Canadian forces were fighting a war of attrition around Caen facing the bulk of the German armor as division after division was fed into Normandy. Like a pressure cooker, the fighting intensified until, seven weeks after D-Day, Operation Cobra broke the German line. Quickly Pattons Third Army, operational from 1 August, flooded through the gap exploiting the German confusion, encircling what was left of the German armies in the Falaise Pocket and advancing quickly through into Brittany. Three weeks later, the Battle of Normandy was over, the routed German Army-without most of its heavy weapons left in the Falaise Pocket or on the banks of the Seine-was retreating helter skelter back towards Germany and the Low Countries pursued by the Allies in a reverse of the 1940 Blitzkrieg campaign.\n<br> \n<br> The three months of war in June-July 1944 were brutal, with losses of front-line troops as heavy as in World War I. The German defense was tenacious, particularly in face of Allied air supremacy. The Allies struggled to get into a position to allow their more mobile forces room for maneuver and and the fighting was ferocious. \n<br> \n<br> When victory came, it came at a cost: 209,672 casualties among the ground forces, including 36,976 killed and 19,221 missing. The Allied air forces lost 16,714 airmen. The corresponding German losses were even more significant: some 450,000 men, of whom 240,000 were killed or wounded. More important to the Germans were the losses of heavy equipment-tanks, assault guns, artillery, personnel carriers. As an example, 12th SS Panzer Division had lost 94% of its armor, nearly all of its artillery and 70% of its vehicles. With c20,000 men and 150 tanks before the campaign, after Falaise it had 300 men and 10 tanks. \n<br> \n<br> Mixing text, maps and images, many of them specially commissioned including aerial photography, The Normandy Battlefields: Bocage and Breakout explains and interprets the complexities of the Normandy campaign in an original and cohesive package.\n<br> \n<a class=read-more>show more</a>', 0, 35.37, NULL, 10, 2017, 1, NULL, '2019-11-21 21:47:30', '2019-11-21 21:47:30', 7, 'Leo Marriott');

Using forced and slave labor they built a chain of defensive positions, coastal batteries, and beach defenses from the top of Norway to the Franco-Spanish border. However, as was so typical of the Nazis, while the bunkers and batteries seem impressively constructed, and the Atlantic Wall has left a permanent reminder of the years of Nazi domination, it was crippled by lack of strategic planning, internal bickering, and a multitude of command structures that did not communicate with each other effectively. In June 1944 the Allies burst through the wall, and while it took many lives to break the crust of the German defenses, the vaunted Atlantic Wall proved ineffective save for the fortresses the Allies bypassed and subdued later. Using the same formula as in their books on The Normandy Battlefields and Race to the Rhine, Leo Marriott and Simon Forty combine bespoke aerial photography with old photographs, maps, and current illustrations to provide a pictorial analysis of the subject-Around 500 illustrations ensure the subject is well covered. After opening sections on the construction of the wall, the defensive plan, and the different structures that were built, Hitlers Atlantic Wall yesterday and today provides a survey of the key locations and what can be seen today-including many of the museums that interpret them. The bulk of the book is divided geographically by country, dealing with France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway. After 70 years, the Atlantic Wall is still a remarkable reminder of the war years, and one that continues to fascinate.\n<br> \n<a class=read-more>show more</a>', 0, 35.53, NULL, 10, 2016, 1, NULL, '2019-11-21 21:47:30', '2019-11-21 21:47:30', 7, 'George Forty');

Anne Glenconner reveals the real events behind The Crown as well as her own life of drama, tragedy and courage, with the wonderful wit and extraordinary resilience which define her.\n<br> \n<br> Anne Glenconner has been close to the Royal Family since childhood. Eldest child of the 5th Earl of Leicester, she was, as a daughter, described as the greatest disappointment by her family as she was unable to inherit. Her childhood home Holkham Hall is one of the grandest estates in England. Bordering Sandringham the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were frequent playmates. \n<br> \n<br> From Maid of Honour at the Queens Coronation to Lady in Waiting to Princess Margaret, Lady Glenconner is a unique witness to royal history, as well as an extraordinary survivor of a generation of aristocratic women trapped without inheritance and burdened with social expectations. \n<br> \n<br> She married the charismatic but highly volatile Colin Tennant, Lord Glenconner, who became the owner of Mustique. Together they turned the island into a paradise for the rich and famous, including Mick Jagger and David Bowie, and it became a favourite retreat for Princess Margaret. \n<br> \n<br> But beneath the glitz and glamour there has also lurked tragedy. On Lord Glenconners death in 2010 he left his fortune to a former employee. And of their five children, two grown-up sons died, while a third son had to be nursed back from a coma by Anne, after having suffered a near fatal accident. \n<br> \n<br> Anne Glenconner writes with extraordinary wit, generosity and courage and she exposes what life was like in her gilded cage, revealing the role of her great friendship with Princess Margaret, and the freedom she can now finally enjoy in later life.

His record bests those of legendary investors, including Warren Buffett, George Soros and Ray Dalio. Yet Simons and his strategies are shrouded in mystery. The financial industry has long craved a look inside Simonss secretive hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies and veteran Wall Street Journal reporter Gregory Zuckerman delivers the goods. \n<br> \n<br> After a legendary career as a mathematician and a stint breaking Soviet codes, Simons set out to conquer financial markets with a radical approach. Simons hired physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists - most of whom knew little about finance - to amass piles of data and build algorithms hunting for the deeply hidden patterns in global markets. Experts scoffed, but Simons and his colleagues became some of the richest in the world, their strategy of creating mathematical models and crunching data embraced by almost every industry. \n<br> \n<br> As Renaissance became a major player in the financial world, its executives began exerting influence on other areas. Simons became a major force in scientific research, education and Democratic politics, funding Hilary Clintons presidential campaign. While senior executive Robert Mercer is more responsible than anyone else for the Trump presidency, placing Steve Bannon in the campaign, funding Trumps victorious 2016 effort and backing alt-right publication Breitbart. Mercer also impacted the success of the Brexit campaign. For all his prescience, Simons failed to anticipate how Mercers activity would impact his firm and the world. \n<br> \n<br> In this fast-paced narrative, Zuckerman examines how Simons launched a quantitative revolution on Wall Street, and reveals the impact that Simons, the quiet billionaire king of the quants, has had on worlds well beyond finance.\n<br> \n<a class=read-more>show more</a>', 0, 26.56, NULL, 10, 2019, 1, NULL, '2019-11-21 21:47:30', '2019-11-21 21:47:30', 9, 'Gregory Zuckerman');

With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on...something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun. You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you dont just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look in the wild. In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Javas built-in pattern support in your own code. You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead).\n<br> You want to learn how those principles will help the next time youre up a creek without a design paddle pattern. Most importantly, you want to learn the secret language of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. Youll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isnt as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter.

Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language.\n<br> In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: * Syntax * Objects * Functions * Inheritance * Arrays * Regular expressions * Methods * Style * Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, youll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.

Will the people who need to hear this story believe it? Is it true? All marketers tell stories. And if they do it right, we believe them. We believe that wine tastes better in a $20 glass than a $1 glass. We believe that an $80,000 Porsche is vastly superior to a $36,000 Volkswagen thats virtually the same car. We believe that $225 sneakers make our feet feel better--and look cooler--than a $25 brand. And believing it makes it true. As Seth Godin has taught hundreds of thousands of marketers and students around the world, great marketers dont talk about features or even benefits. Instead, they tell a story--a story we want to believe, whether its factual or not. In a world where most people have an infinite number of choices and no time to make them, every organization is a marketer, and all marketing is about telling stories. Marketers succeed when they tell us a story that fits our worldview, a story that we intuitively embrace and then share with our friends. Think of the Dyson vacuum cleaner, or Fiji water, or the iPod. But beware: If your stories are inauthentic, you cross the line from fib to fraud. Marketers fail when they are selfish and scurrilous, when they abuse the tools of their trade and make the world worse. Thats a lesson learned the hard way by telemarketers, cigarette companies, and sleazy politicians. But for the rest of us, its time to embrace the power of the story. As Godin writes, Stories make it easier to understand the world. Stories are the only way we know to spread an idea. Marketers didnt invent storytelling.

New library features include pervasive use of functional interfaces and streams, the java.time package for manipulating dates and times, and numerous minor enhancements such as convenience factory methods for collections.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> In this new edition of Effective Java, Bloch updates the work to take advantage of these new language and library features, and provides specific best practices for their use. Javas increased support for multiple paradigms increases the need for best-practices advice, and this book delivers. \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> As in previous editions, each chapter consists of several items, each presented in the form of a short, standalone essay that provides specific advice, insight into Java platform subtleties, and updated code examples. The comprehensive descriptions and explanations for each item illuminate what to do, what not to do, and why. Coverage includes:\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Updated techniques and best practices on classic topics, including objects, classes, methods, libraries, and generics\n<br> How to avoid the traps and pitfalls of commonly misunderstood subtleties of the platform\n<br> Focus on the language and its most fundamental libraries, such as java.lang and java.util\n<br> \n<a class=read-more>show more</a>', 55, 39.92, NULL, 10, 2018, 1, NULL, '2019-11-21 21:47:30', '2019-11-21 21:47:30', 9, 'Joshua Bloch');

So here is a book about the modern experience of mortality - about what its like to get old and die, how medicine has changed this and how it hasnt, where our ideas about death have gone wrong.

It combines rock-solid statistics coverage with compelling visual story-telling to address the conceptual difficulties that students learning statistics for the first time often encounter in introductory courses - guiding students away from rote memorization and toward critical thinking and problem solving. Field masterfully weaves in a unique, action-packed story starring Zach, a character who thinks like a student, processing information, and the challenges of understanding it, in the same way a statistics novice would. Illustrated with stunning graphic novel-style art and featuring Socratic dialogue, the story captivates readers as it introduces them to concepts, eliminating potential statistics anxiety. \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> The book assumes no previous statistics knowledge nor does it require the use of data analysis software.

Prior to the revolution, Elpis citizens were unable to see their flaws and limitations, believing themselves talented and special. This led to a self-absorbed society in which hard work and the collective good were undervalued and eroded.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> To combat this, Professor Milton Grey invented the reality prism, a hat that allowed its wearers to see themselves as they really were - flaws and all. Faced with the truth, Elpis citizens revolted and destroyed and banned all reality prisms.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> The Mysterious Disappearance\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Zach and Alice are born soon after all the prisms have been destroyed. Zach, a musician who doesn\'t understand science, and Alice, a geneticist who is also a whiz at statistics, are in love.

More important, it\'s a book about selective breeding on a far, far grander scale-a scale that encompasses all life on Earth. We\'d call it evolution.\n<br> \n<br> A unique fusion of art, science, and history, this book celebrates the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin\'s monumental work The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, and is intended as a tribute to what Darwin might have achieved had he possessed that elusive missing piece to the evolutionary puzzle-the knowledge of how individual traits are passed from one generation to the next. With the benefit of a century and a half of hindsight, Katrina van Grouw explains evolution by building on the analogy that Darwin himself used-comparing the selective breeding process with natural selection in the wild, and, like Darwin, featuring a multitude of fascinating examples.\n<br> \n<br> This is more than just a book about pets and livestock, however. The revelation of Unnatural Selection is that identical traits can occur in all animals, wild and domesticated, and both are governed by the same evolutionary principles. As van Grouw shows, animals are plastic things, constantly changing. In wild animals the changes are usually too slow to see-species appear to stay the same. When it comes to domesticated animals, however, change happens fast, making them the perfect model of evolution in action.\n<br> \n<br> Suitable for the lay reader and student, as well as the more seasoned biologist, and featuring more than four hundred breathtaking illustrations of living animals, skeletons, and historical specimens, Unnatural Selection will be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in natural history and the history of evolutionary thinking.\n<br> \n<a class=\"read-more\">show more</a>', 0, 83.24, NULL, 10, 2018, 1, NULL, '2019-11-22 22:44:19', '2019-11-22 22:44:19', 2, 'Katrina van Grouw');

It is an integral, unchallenged and essential component of our modern social, mercantile, scientific, mechanical and intellectual landscapes. The items we value in our daily lives - a camera, phone, computer, bicycle, car, a dishwasher perhaps - all sport components that fit together with precision and operate with near perfection. We also assume that the more precise a device the better it is. And yet whilst we live lives peppered and larded with precision, we are not, when we come to think about it, entirely sure what precision is, or what it means. How and when did it begin to build the modern world?\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Simon Winchester seeks to answer these questions through stories of precision\'s pioneers. Exactly takes us back to the origins of the Industrial Age, to Britain where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John `Iron-Mad\' Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. Thomas Jefferson exported their discoveries to the United States as manufacturing developed in the early twentieth century, with Britain\'s Henry Royce developing the Rolls Royce and Henry Ford mass producing cars, Hattori\'s Seiko and Leica lenses, to today\'s cutting-edge developments from Europe, Asia and North America.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture?
